## difference between display: none and visibility
Note: What’s the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden? An element with display: none will be completely removed from the web page. An element with visibility: hidden, however, will not be visible on the web page, but the space reserved for it will.

Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property.

The visibility property can be set to one of the following values:

hidden — hides an element.
visible — displays an element.
collapse — collapses an element.

box sizing: content-box (default) - rendered width = width + padding + border + margin
box sizing: border-box (width property becomes actual rendered width) - rendered width = (width - (padding + border + margin)) + (padding + border + margin);
