        <Paragraph>
            Welcome to my collection of ready-made HTML and CSS components! This site is a casual and straightforward
            resource for anyone looking to quickly prototype or build web projects without getting bogged down in esign.
            Feel free to take whatever you needâ€”everything here is open source or under MIT licenses. I made this site
            to save time and keep things simple, so you can focus on what matters most: development.

        <Head2>About Dev</Head2>
        <Paragraph>
            Hi, I'm ThuRein, you can call me Tom. I created this site to sharpen my front-end development skills.
            Inspired by various designs I've come across, I built this project to make prototyping easier for myself and
            others. It's all about cutting down the time spent tweaking design elements so we can focus on logic and
            algorithms.
